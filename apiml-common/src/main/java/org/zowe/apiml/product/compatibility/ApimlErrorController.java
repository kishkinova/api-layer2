 * This class is used to reconcile the breaking change between Spring Boot 2.5 and Zuul. The breaking change
 * is due to ErrorController.getErrorPath being removed in Spring Boot 2.5. A BeanPostProcessor is used
 * to proxy ZuulHandlerMapping, intercepting the code execution that leads to the NoSuchMethodError.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This should be removed when the APIML migrates away from Zuul to Spring Cloud Gateway.
