## Running the API Mediation Layer on Local Machine

The API mediation layer can run on a z/OS system or your local machine (Mac/Linux/Windows).

To start each server individually with default settings for running on your local machine, run the following statements.

The default settings for running on local machine are stored in directory [/config/local/](/config/local/).


### Gateway Service

```shell
java -jar gateway-service/build/libs/gateway-service.jar --spring.config.additional-location=file:./config/local/gateway-service.yml
```


#### HTTPS

By default, the gateway runs in encrypted mode (HTTPS) for northbound traffic using signed certificates in Java keystores.

To override this and run the gateway without TLS encryption, add the following two arguments:
    
    -Denvironment.scheme=http -Denvironment.sslEnabled=false

The source code contains sample certificates that are used by configuration for testing on your local machine. 
Do not use these certificates in other environments. More details can be found at [/keystore/local_ca/README.md](/keystore/local_ca/README.md).


### Discovery Service

**Note:** If you want to run the discovery service using IntelliJ Run Dashboard, you need to add `https` in the `Active profiles` field in `Edit Configuration`. 

```shell
java -jar discovery-service/build/libs/discovery-service.jar --spring.config.additional-location=file:./config/local/discovery-service.yml
```


### API Catalog

```shell
java -jar api-catalog-services/build/libs/api-catalog-services.jar --spring.config.additional-location=file:./config/local/api-catalog-service.yml
```


### Sample Application - Discoverable Client

```shell
java -jar discoverable-client/build/libs/discoverable-client.jar --spring.config.additional-location=file:./config/local/discoverable-client.yml
```

### Sample Application -EnablerV1Sample 

```shell
java -jar integration-enabler-spring-v1-sample-app/build/libs/enabler-springboot-1.5.9.RELEASE-sample.jar --spring.config.additional-location=file:./config/local/integration-enabler-spring-v1-sample-app.yml
```

### Helloworld Jersey

To run Helloworld Jersey, you need to have Apache Tomcat installed in your computer. Follow the steps below:

1.  Download Apache Tomcat 8.0.39 and install it. 
2.  Build Helloworld Jersey through IntelliJ or by running `gradlew helloworld-jersey:build` in the terminal. 

3.  Enable HTTPS for Apache Tomcat. In order to do that, there are few additional steps that are needed to be done:
    * Go to `apache-tomcat-8.0.39-windows-x64\conf` directory (the full path depends on where you decided to install Tomcat) and open `server.xml` file with some text editor as Administrator. Add the xml block below:
        ```xml
               <Connector port="8080" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol"
                              maxThreads="150" SSLEnabled="true" scheme="https" secure="true"
                              clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"
                              keystoreFile="{your-project-directory}\api-layer\keystore\localhost\localhost.keystore.p12"
                              keystorePass="password"
                                                    />
        ```
        Be also sure to comment the HTTP connector which uses the same port.
    * Navigate to the `WEB-INF/` located in `helloworld-jersey` module and add the following xml block to the `web.xml` file, right below the `<servlet-mapping>` tag:
        ```xml
        <security-constraint>
                <web-resource-collection>
                    <web-resource-name>Protected resource</web-resource-name>
                    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
                    <http-method>GET</http-method>
                    <http-method>POST</http-method>
                </web-resource-collection>
                <user-data-constraint>
                    <transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>
                </user-data-constraint>
            </security-constraint>
        ```
4. Run `gradlew tomcatRun` with these additional parameters: `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore="{your-project-directory}\api-layer\keystore\localhost\localhost.truststore.p12" -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword="password"`. 
If you need some more information about SSL configuration status while deploying, use this parameter `-Djavax.net.debug=SSL`.

5. Navigate to [https://localhost:10011]([https://localhost:10011]) and check if the service is registered to the discovery service. You should be able to reach the following endpoints using HTTPS:

    * [https://localhost:10011/eureka/apps/HELLOJERSEY/localhost:hellojersey:10016](https://localhost:10011/eureka/apps/HELLOJERSEY/localhost:hellojersey:10016) for metadata and service information
    * [https://localhost:10016/hellojersey/api-doc](https://localhost:10016/hellojersey/api-doc) which contains the API documentation
    * [https://localhost:10016/hellojersey/application/health](https://localhost:10016/hellojersey/application/health) for the health check endpoint containing the status of the application
    * [https://localhost:10016](https://localhost:10016) for the homepage 
    * [https://localhost:10016/hellojersey/application/info](https://localhost:10016/hellojersey/application/info) for the service informations such as hostname, port etc
    * [https://localhost:10016/hellojersey/v1/greeting](https://localhost:10016/hellojersey/v1/greeting) for the greeting endpoint
    
    Go to the [API Catalog](https://localhost:10010/ui/v1/apicatalog) and check if the API documentation of the service is retrieved.

### Default Discovery Timing Settings 

Default timings can require up to 3 minutes for service startup discovery and shutdown to be registered.
To change this settings so services register/de-register quicker, then append the following to the existing arguments

These settings are for development purposes only, it may result in false positive or unexpected behaviour.

```
-Deureka.instance.leaseExpirationDurationInSeconds=6 
-Deureka.instance.leaseRenewalIntervalInSeconds=5 
-Deureka.client.registryFetchIntervalSeconds=5 
-Deureka.client.initialInstanceInfoReplicationIntervalSeconds=5
```


### Default API Catalog Refresh/Cache update Timing Settings (UI only)

Increase the service cache frequency rate which updates the Catalog UI with discovered service statuses.

These settings are for development purposes only, it may result in false positive or unexpected behaviour.

```
-Dmfaas.service-registry.serviceFetchDelayInMillis=10000 
-Dmfaas.service-registry.cacheRefreshUpdateThresholdInMillis=10000 
-Dmfaas.service-registry.cacheRefreshInitialDelayInMillis=10000 
-Dmfaas.service-registry.cacheRefreshRetryDelayInMillis=10000
```


### Debugging

To turn on debugging messages for Zowe and informational messages for third-party dependencies:

    --spring.profiles.active=dev

To turn on SSL/TLS protocol debugging:

    -Djavax.net.debug=ssl:handshake 


### IntelliJ Idea setup

If your editor of choice happens to be Idea and you wnat to use its 'Run Dashboard' refer to [Setup your Idea](./idea-setup.md).

### Running multiple instances of Eureka locally

 To run multiple instances of Eureka from your local environment follow these steps:

 1.  Open the _hosts_ file located inside `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc` directory as Administrator and add one or more virtual ip â€“ hostname entries to allow discovery peers on your laptop.

     *Example:*
  
     ```
         127.0.0.2       localhost1
         127.0.0.3       localhost2
     ```

     * On Mac, this can be done by editing `/etc/hosts` file as the root:

             sudo nano /etc/hosts

         Add:
         
             127.0.0.2 localhost2
             127.0.0.3 localhost3

         Activate:
         
             dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

         Add virtual local network adapter on Mac:

             sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.2
             sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.3
         
         It can be removed issuing: `ifconfig lo0 -alias 127.0.0.2`

 2.  Modify the [discovery-service.yml](../config/local/discovery-service.yml) and change the values of _discoveryLocations_, _hostname_, _ipAddress_ and _port_ as in the example below:

     *Example:*

     ```yaml
     environment:
         cacheRefreshDelayInMillis: 10000
         discoveryLocations: http://eureka:password@discoveryInstance1:10022/eureka,http://eureka:password@discoveryInstance2:10033/eureka
         dsIpAddress: 0.0.0.0
         eurekaPassword: password
         eurekaUserId: eureka
         hostname: discoveryInstance1
         initialCacheRefreshDelayInMillis: 10000
         ipAddress: 127.0.0.2
         port: 10022
         preferIpAddress: false
         registryServiceInitialDelayInSeconds: 10
         registryServiceRetryDelayInSeconds: 5
         truststore: keystore/local/localhost_truststore.jks
         truststorePassword: trustword
         truststoreType: JKS
         updateThresholdInMillis: 10000

     spring:
         output:
             ansi:
                 enabled: always
     ``` 

 3.  Run the _DiscoveryServiceApplication_ and once it's up, modify the *.yml* file again changing _hostname_, _ipAddress_ and _port_ with the values chosen for the other peer.

     * Without IntelliJ IDEA, you can run `npm run api-layer-multi` to run all the services from JARs. This task starts two discovery services with other API Mediation Layer services using configuration file in [config/local-multi](/config/local-multi/).

 4. Run _DiscoveryServiceApplication_ again.

 5.  Go to 127.0.0.**x**:**yyyyy** check the multiple instances registered with each other. If this was successful, the **registered-replicas** and **available-replicas** fields will contain the URL(s) of the other instance(s) of Eureka that you've created in the previous steps.

 **Note:** This configuration will work when the _preferIpAddress_ parameter is set to _false_. If you set it to _true_, you need to modify the value of _discoveryLocations:_ to use IP address instead of hostname, otherwise Eureka won't be able to find the services registered and as consequence the **available-replicas** will be empty.
  
   *Example:*
   
  ```
  discoveryLocations: http://eureka:password@127.0.0.2:10022/eureka,http://eureka:password@127.0.0.3:10033/eureka
   ```
   instead of 
   ```
   discoveryLocations: http://eureka:password@discoveryInstance1:10022/eureka,http://eureka:password@discoveryInstance2:10033/eureka
   ```
